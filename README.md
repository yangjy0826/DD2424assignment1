The main task for this assignment is to train and test a 1-layer network (fully connected layer) with multiple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset based on MATLAB. You can refer to the "Assignment1.pdf" file for more detail. <br />
Because this is only a one layer network, the accuracy of classification is only around 40%. My result in detail is in the files "DL_assignment1.pdf" and "DL_assignment1_bonus point.pdf".
